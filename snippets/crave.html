Popcorn™</h1>
<p>Popcorn™ delivers boot-speed infrastructure that satisfies across the
stack — from hands-on engineers to high-stakes boardrooms.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="developers">👩‍💻 Developers</h2>
<p>Popcorn™ clears the clutter: no base image stew, no bloated init, no
surprise daemons. Just code that boots like an appliance — fast, clean,
and repeatable. CI/CD pipelines simplify. Cold starts evaporate. And
devs ship with joy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your code <em>is</em> the system. And it pops.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="product-managers">🧭 Product Managers</h2>
<p>Popcorn™ makes environments invisible and delivery reliable. Boot
times are sub-second. Environments are reproducible. Rollbacks are just
image swaps. Product teams move fast, deploy fearlessly, and sleep
better.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fewer war rooms. Faster releases.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="cfos">💰 CFOs</h2>
<p>Popcorn™ cuts your cloud bill. Tiny images, high density, low RAM
use, and microVM isolation mean you run more with less. Immutable
workloads mean fewer incidents and lower support cost.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spend less per boot. Maximize your margins.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="site-reliability-engineers-sres">🛠️ Site Reliability Engineers
(SREs)</h2>
<p>Popcorn™ gives you the trifecta: predictability, observability, and
calm. Immutable images boot in milliseconds with no drift, no zombies,
no background surprises. Just pure signal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fewer incidents. More uptime. No midnight gremlins.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="ceos">🧑‍💼 CEOs</h2>
<p>Popcorn™ simplifies your platform story: fewer tools, fewer vendors,
and a unified infrastructure that moves with your business. Security,
velocity, and operational confidence — baked in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Infrastructure becomes a strategic asset.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="board-of-directors">🪑 Board of Directors</h2>
<p>Popcorn™ reduces attack surface, eliminates drift, and enables
verifiable supply chains. Immutable, signed images plus measured boot
give auditors and compliance teams hard guarantees — not wishful
thinking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reduced risk. Cleaner governance. Shareholder confidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="cisos-security-teams">🔒 CISOs / Security Teams</h2>
<p>Popcorn™ has no package managers, no SSH, no users, and no daemon
ports. It’s secure by construction with zero-runtime attack surface.
Boot integrity is provable. Attestation is simple.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Security isn’t an afterthought — it’s a kernel feature.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="compliance-risk-officers">🧾 Compliance &amp; Risk Officers</h2>
<p>Popcorn™ reduces the compliance blast radius. Workloads are
immutable, auditable, and versioned. That means easier attestations,
cleaner logs, and fewer policy exceptions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shorter audits. Smaller scopes. Fewer surprises.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="platform-engineers">⚙️ Platform Engineers</h2>
<p>Popcorn™ is the foundation you’ve always wanted: reproducible,
bootable, pre-tested workloads with zero base OS maintenance. Golden
images, made real.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From snowflakes to snapshots. Your platform, distilled.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="innovation-leads-rd">💡 Innovation Leads / R&amp;D</h2>
<p>Popcorn™ is perfect for rapid iteration — lightweight images, instant
boot, easy teardown. Build, test, ship, discard. Explore freely without
cloud waste.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lab speed at prod scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="edge-iot-ops">🌐 Edge &amp; IoT Ops</h2>
<p>Popcorn™ boots anywhere — fast. Whether it’s a factory edge node or a
solar-powered station in the desert, Popcorn’s tiny size and
deterministic boot make it ideal for constrained and remote
environments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Minimal power. Max reliability.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="devops-release-engineering">📦 DevOps &amp; Release
Engineering</h2>
<p>Popcorn™ eliminates flaky deployments. Every image is a sealed unit:
app, kernel, rootfs — no drift, no missing deps. Build once, ship
everywhere, and debug almost never.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Artifacts you can trust.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="it-desktop-ops">🖥️ IT / Desktop Ops</h2>
<p>Boot dev environments or internal sandboxes instantly, with no config
drift and no full OS installs. Perfect for secure laptops, hackathons,
and air-gapped labs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No reimaging. Just re-popping.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="sustainability-green-it">🌍 Sustainability / Green IT</h2>
<p>Popcorn™ uses fewer resources: faster boots, lower memory, higher
density. That translates to less energy use and better carbon efficiency
at scale.</p>
