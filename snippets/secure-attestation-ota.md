# 🎯Whether you're deploying a hardened kernel, a microservice chain, or a full containerized runtime, SwiftBoot ensures that the entire system is locked, labeled, and immutable <em>before</em> it boots.

| Capability                   | SwiftBoot                     | Traditional Approach        |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 📦 Dependency Management     | CI/CD controlled              | Host-resolved or scripted   |
| 🧪 Config + Patch Hygiene    | Verified at build             | Applied at runtime          |
| 🔐 Supply Chain Attestation  | ✅ SBOM + Sigstore ready       | ❌ None or external          |
| 🚫 OTA Patch Hell            | Eliminated via full image     | Partial updates, drift risk |
| 📋 Policy Compliance         | Enforced pre-deploy           | Best-effort or manual       |
| 🧯 Rollback + Recovery       | Built into boot flow          | Manual or break/fix         |
| 🔍 Audit + Reproducibility   | Guaranteed via `.swiftboot`   | ❌ Fragile and host-dependent |
