# 🚀 SwiftBoot for Edge, IoT, and Embedded Systems

SwiftBoot isn't just minimal — it's surgical. In power-starved, space-constrained, and latency-critical environments, SwiftBoot brings your kernel, your app, and nothing else — ready in **under 0.25s on ARM**, **under 0.5s on x86**, unless your hardware is throttled by power constraints.

## 💤 From Deepest Sleep to Operational in <0.5s

SwiftBoot supports the **deepest ACPI-defined power states** like **S5 (Soft Off)** or even **G3 (Mechanical Off)**. It idles in ultra-low-power mode, waiting for GPIO, CAN, or RTC triggers. When signaled, it goes **from cold iron to app logic in under half a second**.

- ✅ **ARM SoCs (e.g., Cortex-A53, A76)** boot to app in **<0.25s**
- ✅ **x86/UEFI** boots land at **<0.5s**
- ⚡ Even underclocked or battery-constrained CPUs can hit **sub-second** cold boots
- 💤 **Zero drain.** True power-off with event-driven wake

## 🧠 Fits Where Nothing Else Can

SwiftBoot is a surgical Linux stack: **kernel + OCI rootfs + app**. No initrd. No systemd. No bloat.

- **<10MB** total image size
- **<20MB** RAM at runtime
- Boot from NOR, NAND, eMMC, SD, or SPI flash
- ROM-ready builds for field and factory

## ⏱️ Guaranteed Sub-Second Startup

In time-critical systems like automotive, sub-2s boot is a hard requirement. SwiftBoot exceeds it **by 4–8×**.

According to **AUTOSAR Adaptive Platform** and **ISO 26262** design guidance:

- ECUs supporting ADAS, camera, and safety systems **must be operational in ≤2s**
- SwiftBoot enables app availability in:
    - **<0.25s on ARM**
    - **<0.5s on x86**

- **ISO 26262** – Functional safety requirements for automotive electronics
- **UN Regulation R155 / R156** – Secure software updates, cybersecurity traceability
- **ASIL-D** – Highest automotive safety integrity level (deterministic boot required)

## 🔐 Bonus: CI-integrated, OCI-native, Secure by Design

SwiftBoot containers are:

- **Immutable**, signed, and CI-reproducible
- Fully traceable from Git commit to boot image
- Easy to A/B test or roll back — without touching the kernel
- Embedded-update friendly: use `mender`, `rauc`, or custom pipelines
