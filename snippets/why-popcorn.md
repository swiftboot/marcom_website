# 🍿 Why Use Popcorn™

**Popcorn™ is the fastest, most efficient way to deploy cloud-native applications using microVMs.**

When milliseconds matter, Popcorn™ delivers.

## 🚀 Instant Boot = Instant Scale

Popcorn™ fuses your application and kernel into a single bootable image. That means your microVMs go from *cold storage* to *running workload* in **under a second** — no OS boot, no container daemon, no spin-up delay.

> Your app *pops* the moment it's needed. Perfect for autoscaling, CI/CD, and bursty workloads.

---

## 🧈 Buttery Smooth Performance

Unlike containers, Popcorn™ runs on **bare metal microVMs** with **hardware-level isolation** — without sacrificing speed. It’s designed for **zero-jitter cold starts**, **low-latency IO**, and **predictable runtime behavior** across every launch.

> The result? Fewer surprises. Happier SREs.

---

## 📦 One Image, All You Need

Popcorn™ packages:

- Your **application**
- A **minimal kernel**
- An **OCI-compliant root filesystem**

...into a single immutable image. No more managing base OS versions or dependencies across environments.

> Build it once, run it anywhere microVMs run — even air-gapped.

---

## 🔒 Secure by Construction

Popcorn™ minimizes your attack surface:

- No systemd
- No SSH
- No package manager
- No users
- No legacy drivers
- No blobs
- No indigestion
- No daemons waving backdoor ports
- No gremlins hiding behind systemd

Just your app, in a tamper-resistant, read-only image — with full support for measured boot and signed workloads.

> Fewer moving parts. Fewer exploits.

---

## 🧮 Smaller. Faster. Cheaper.

Popcorn™ images are tiny — often **<10MB**, boot in **<1 second**, and use **~4x less memory** than traditional VMs. That translates directly to **lower cloud costs**, higher density, and more responsive workloads.

> Fit more apps per node. Pay less per workload.

## 🟡 Popcorn™ is what microVMs were meant to be.

If your team is ready for:

- Serverless speed
- VM-grade security
- Container-like simplicity

...then you're ready to pop.
