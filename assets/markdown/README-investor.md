# Popcorn by SwiftBoot
**Your App. Your Kernel. Zero Overhead.**

## The Product
Popcorn fuses your OCI container with a SwiftBoot kernel into a single immutable image that boots in under 1 second — on bare metal or in cloud VMs — with **no guest OS**, no runtime daemons, and zero drift.  
Think Firecracker + Bottlerocket, distilled into a sealed artifact with sub-second cold starts and a fully observable, CI-pinned lifecycle.

## What's Working Now
- ⚡ Sub-second boot tested on AWS Nitro, Azure Gen2, GCP KVM, QEMU, and bare metal.
- 🧠 Proven SwiftBoot kernels with overlay config — never patched, always reproducible.
- 📊 CI-driven boot validation, config pinning, and live telemetry across all builds.
- 🍿 Demo “seed” images: nginx, redis, postgres, alpine shell — all cloud deployable.

## What’s Next
- 🚀 Customer-facing CI/CD to build and publish their own Popcorn images.
- 🛠️ Final polish on onboarding flow and developer CLI.
- 🤝 Strategic partners and first customers for go-to-market and early integration.

## The Ask
Seeking [$X] to complete self-serve pipeline and launch initial GTM.  
Ask includes [Y] months of founder runway to sustain momentum and unlock revenue.
